* **What does it do - **

  * Our web app asks for user info (occupation, weather, state, activities) and it generates a city card with information. It will give the user a choice to either decline or accept the city. The matched cities will then be listed in a separate page. You can access that information by clicking on the house icon at the navbar.
* **What is the purpose of our website - **

  * The main purpose of our project is to give people more information on the areas they choose to live in to ensure that they choose an area well suited for them in safety and lifestyle. The main feature is to offer matches to college students and interns. The users will have to input their housing preferences such as weather, region, public transportation accessibility, lifestyle, and crime rate. The web application will then generate possible matches and the user will have the choice to deny or accept with buttons. These matches will then be stored in a database, so that the user can always go back and review what their preferences were and edit it. We would like to also implement the airbnb and zillow API's to offer agents and housing to the users.
* **Problem statement - **

  * The problem that our capstone pod would like to solve are the issues that come with relocating to a different place (city/state). People relocating lack the experience and the familiarity of the city or area to choose housing that is safe and aligns with their hobbies, values, and lifestyle. They lack knowledge or awareness and the sense of the area like the accessibility or public transportation. Our target audience are young adults who are seeking help for relocation for work.
